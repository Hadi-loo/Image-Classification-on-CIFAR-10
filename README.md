# Image Classification on CIFAR-10

In this repository, I have tried different traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

At the end of this project, I have compared the performance of different models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The models that I have used are:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Fully Connected Neural Network
5. Convolutional Neural Network
